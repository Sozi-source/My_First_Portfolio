                <h1> Improving Child Nutrition in Urban Kenya </h1>
                <p> In Kenya's urban centers, busy working mothers often struggle to provide their children with proper nutrition. This challenge can lead to poor growth and health outcomes for young children. By establishing quality daycare centers that offer affordable and nutritious meals, we can address this need while supporting working parents. These centers would not only ensure children receive balanced diets but also promote healthy development and early education.</p>
